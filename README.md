# Rust
Personal repository for my [Rustlang](https://www.rust-lang.org/) learning.

# Instalation
Apparently, in order for compilation to happen you need some C linkers, in my case I chose MSVC linker from Microsoft VS C++.
I use VS Code as my text editor (although it's almost like a complete IDE). In the future I may or may not use [Visual Rust](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vosen.VisualRust), a VS extension for Rust Dev. I am also interested in using [Rust Lang Server](https://github.com/rust-lang/rls) for integration with Vim. In the meantime, I will stick with VS Code.
  ## Sidenote
  ~ Rust Lang Server keeps crashing on VS Code and I have no reason why. ~
  

# TODO
- [ ] Build something nice.
- [ ] Learn data structures and algorithms for real.
- [ ] Convince everyone else to use Rust instead.
- [ ] Translate code to english for more visibility.
