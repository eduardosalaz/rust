# Rust
Personal repository for my [Rustlang](https://www.rust-lang.org/) learning.

# Instalation
~~Apparently, in order for compilation to happen you need some C linkers, in my case I chose MSVC linker from Microsoft VS C++.
I use VS Code as my text editor (although it's almost like a complete IDE). In the future I may or may not use [Visual Rust](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vosen.VisualRust), a VS extension for Rust Dev.~~ After having many troubles with the C Linker and additional libs I decided to now use Linux as my OS to develop, using MinGW64 for the compilation.
  ## Sidenote
  ~~Rust Lang Server keeps crashing on VS Code and I have no reason why.~~
  You can't open multiple Rust Folders at once in VS Code without RLS crashing so you may want to use another directory for your
  working files (Workspaces don't work).
  

# TODO
- [ ] Build something nice.
- [ ] Learn data structures and algorithms for real.
- [ ] Convince everyone else to use Rust instead.
- [x] Translate code to english for more visibility.
