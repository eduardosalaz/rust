/*Euler 9:
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.
There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.
WORKS SUCCESFULLY but for some reason C is calculated as 425 where it should be 412~.
